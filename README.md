### Hi and welcome! ðŸ‘‹ 

I am a Ph.D. research scholar specializing in B2B marketing. My interest in the potential of data analytics and data science was sparked during a seminar on big data and machine learning that I had the privilege of attending during my Ph.D. studies. Since then, I have been driven to further explore the field of data analytics and data science to gain a deeper understanding of how it can help organizations make better-informed decisions by extracting insights from large and complex datasets. I am constantly seeking opportunities to enhance my skills and expertise in this exciting and rapidly evolving field.
